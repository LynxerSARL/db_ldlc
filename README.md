This repository demonstrates a small Python GUI.
Running `main.py` opens a mid-sized window that fades in to reveal a dark theme login form.
The title **Hackboot** slides down before the username and password fields appear.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) for a modern look

## Usage

Install the dependency and run the program:

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
python main.py
```

Entering your credentials and pressing **Login** will display them in a simple dialog box.
