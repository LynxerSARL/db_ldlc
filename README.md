This repository contains a Python GUI example that displays a modern login window.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) for a modern theme

## Usage

Install the dependency and execute the demo with Python:

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
python main.py
```

The application will fade in to reveal a dark themed login form asking for a
username and password. After clicking **Login** the entered values are shown in
a dialog box.
